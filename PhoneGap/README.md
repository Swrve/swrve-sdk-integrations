Swrve SDK Cordova Plugin
========================

DEPRECATED
----------
This SDK is no longer supported.

What is Swrve
-------------
Swrve is a single integrated platform delivering everything you need to drive mobile engagement and create valuable consumer relationships on mobile.  
This PhoneGap plugin will enable your app to use all of these features on Android and iOS.

Getting started
---------------
If using the source and not the release zip, make sure you checkout the correct iOS SDK submodule in SwrvePlugin/platforms/ios/SwrveSDK/ using the following command:
```
git submodule init; git submodule sync; git submodule update --force;
```

Have a look at the quick integration guide at http://docs.swrve.com/developer-documentation/integration/phonegap/

Testing
-------
Run the rake task 'rake build'. This will update the demo project with the latest source from the Swrve plugin and compile both Android and iOS platforms.


Both platform targets have native tests that are able to test the wrapper code. There are also two rake tasks that you can run:

```
testIOSInSimulator["OS=8.3\,name='iPad Air'"]
```

```
testAndroidInEmulator["6.0.1"]
```
